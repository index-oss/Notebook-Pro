Absolutely! Let’s summarize everything we’ve done so far for Notebook Pro, including your Supabase setup, testing, and the web app development, so you have a clear picture of the progress. I’ll organize it in a structured way so it’s easy to follow and can be referenced later.

Notebook Pro — Progress Summary

1️⃣ Project Concept

Name: Notebook Pro

Purpose: An online project notebook to store, manage, and discuss your projects with features like:

Add / Edit / Delete projects

Pin important projects

Store scripts, commands, and links

“Discuss Project” button for sharing ideas

Access from anywhere via a browser (hosted on Vercel)


Goal: Central hub for all ongoing, completed, and future projects.



---

2️⃣ Backend Setup with Supabase

Supabase Project: Created a project for Notebook Pro.

Tables created:

1. users — Stores registered users (id, email, password hash, created_at)


2. projects — Stores user projects (title, description, tech stack, features, status, timestamps)


3. pinned_projects — Projects pinned for quick access


4. shared_projects — Projects shared by other users


5. project_submissions — Stores submissions/notes from others


6. project_resources (planned) — For scripts, commands, and links (needs schema fix)



Security: RLS (Row Level Security) enabled initially for controlled access. We also tested disabling RLS for development purposes.

Keys used:

SUPABASE_URL

anon key (for client-side connection)




---

3️⃣ Testing Supabase with Python (Pydroid)

Python SDK: Installed supabase-py via pip (some challenges on Pydroid due to environment compatibility)

Python test script: Successfully tested:

User creation

Adding a project

Pinning a project


Errors found and fixed:

Resource column resource_content missing → needs table update

Invalid UUID syntax → fixed by using correct uuid generated for user/project




---

4️⃣ Frontend / Web App Development

Goal: Single-page web app (index.html) using:

Tailwind CSS (for styling, responsive grid, modern UI)

Supabase JS SDK (v2) for connecting to backend

Vanilla JS for logic


Completed Features in Frontend:

Header with “Discuss Project” button

Main grid layout:

Left: Projects list (Add/Edit/Delete, Pin)

Right: Pinned projects


Add Project modal

Discuss Project modal

Supabase integration:

Fetch projects

Fetch pinned projects

Add project

Pin project

Submit project ideas to shared_projects



Ready for Deployment: Frontend can run on browser locally or be deployed on Vercel.

Placeholders: Supabase URL and anon key included as placeholders to replace with your keys.



---

5️⃣ Pending / Planned Features

Resource management: Store scripts, commands, and links per project (currently table and JS logic need completion).

Keyboard shortcuts: For adding projects or resources quickly.

Enhanced UI:

Modal or sidebar for resources

Toggle pin/unpin

Optional dark/light theme switch


Complete discussion system: Show shared ideas from other users in a list with comments.

Full deployment: Once tested locally, deploy index.html to Vercel for cloud access.

If you want, I can also generate a detailed XML prompt that contains all of this progress, tables, features, and code snippets for future reference or replication.

Do you want me to do that next?
